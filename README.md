# Plotly_challenge

## Overview of the project:

* Create webpage to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer for client, Roza.
* Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
* That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef,volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Objective:
* Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
* Create a bubble chart that will display bacterial cultures per sample when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
* Create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value.
* Adding customization to the dashboard.

## Results:
### Bar Chart

* Addeed an image to the jumbotron.
* Use a custom font style for heading and paragraph of the webpage.
* Added more information about the project as a paragraph on the page.
* Added a navigation bar at the top left corner that allows to reset the dashboard to default at a click.
